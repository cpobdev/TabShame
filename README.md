Very simple Chrome extension test so I can just get a count of all open tabs, as I am a habitual tab-abuser.

Shows a running count of all open tabs across all windows.
The color of the badge text will change depending on how many you have open.

* Green - <= 30
* Yellow > 30 and <=50
* Orange > 50 and <= 75
* Red > 75 tabs
